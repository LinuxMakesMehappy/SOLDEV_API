# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Solana Error Code Explanation API is a backend service designed to help Solana developers quickly understand and resolve Anchor-based program errors. The API accepts error codes as input and leverages AI models to provide human-readable explanations along with practical fix suggestions tailored to Solana and Anchor development. The service will be deployed as a serverless AWS Lambda function with comprehensive testing and security measures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want to submit an Anchor error code via an API endpoint so that I can get explanations without manual lookup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/explain-error` with valid JSON body containing `{ "errorCode": number | string }` THEN the system SHALL accept and process the request
2. WHEN the error code is provided as a numeric value (0 to 4294967295) THEN the system SHALL process it as a valid u32 error code
3. WHEN the error code is provided as a hex string (e.g., "0x1770") THEN the system SHALL convert and process it as a valid error code
4. WHEN the request body is missing the errorCode field THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error message "Missing required field: errorCode"
5. WHEN the error code is invalid (negative, non-numeric string, or out of u32 range) THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error message "Invalid error code format"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging a Solana dApp, I want an AI-generated human-readable explanation of the Anchor error code, including context from Solana/Anchor docs, so I can understand the issue quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid error code is received THEN the system SHALL first attempt to map it to known Anchor/Solana error enums
2. WHEN the error code matches a standard Solana error (0-9999) THEN the system SHALL use the predefined mapping for explanation
3. WHEN the error code is in the custom Anchor range (6000+) THEN the system SHALL treat it as a custom error and use AI inference
4. WHEN no exact match is found THEN the system SHALL use AI to generate an explanation based on common error patterns
5. WHEN generating AI explanations THEN the system SHALL include a concise explanation and 2-3 practical fix suggestions
6. WHEN providing fix suggestions THEN the system SHALL mention Solana-specific tools like `anchor test`, `solana logs`, and common pitfalls
7. WHEN the same error code is requested multiple times THEN the system SHALL use cached responses to reduce latency and costs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As the API maintainer, I want seamless integration with an AI service to ensure reliable translations without downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with AI services THEN the system SHALL support AWS Bedrock as the primary AI provider
2. WHEN AWS Bedrock is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to external APIs (e.g., Grok API) based on environment configuration
3. WHEN making AI requests THEN the system SHALL use configurable environment variables for API keys, model selection, and temperature settings
4. WHEN the AI response is empty or ambiguous THEN the system SHALL fallback to a static explanation from a predefined error database
5. WHEN AI API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return a graceful error message and suggest retry
6. WHEN AI integration fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and return a fallback response within 10 seconds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive unit tests for common Anchor error codes to verify the API's accuracy and robustness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN the system SHALL include tests for at least 10 common error scenarios
2. WHEN testing standard Solana errors THEN the system SHALL verify correct handling of codes like 0 (success) and 1 (InvalidInstructionData)
3. WHEN testing Anchor constraint errors THEN the system SHALL verify correct handling of codes like 2000 (ConstraintSeeds) and 2001 (ConstraintHasOne)
4. WHEN testing custom error scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify AI-generated responses for codes 6000+
5. WHEN testing invalid inputs THEN the system SHALL verify proper error handling for non-numbers and out-of-range values
6. WHEN measuring test coverage THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 90% code coverage
7. WHEN AI services are unavailable during testing THEN the system SHALL use mocked responses to ensure consistent test results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the API to follow best practices to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure data protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting of 100 requests per minute per IP address
2. WHEN processing inputs THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all input data to prevent injection attacks
3. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL only accept HTTPS connections
4. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive data from log entries
5. WHEN storing API keys THEN the system SHALL use AWS SSM Parameter Store or environment variables, never hard-coded values
6. WHEN processing user data THEN the system SHALL comply with GDPR requirements by not storing personal information
7. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL pass security vulnerability scans

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the API deployed as an AWS Lambda function for scalability and cost-efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packaging the application THEN the system SHALL be deployable as an AWS Lambda function using Node.js 20+
2. WHEN exposing the API THEN the system SHALL use AWS API Gateway with a REST endpoint at POST /explain-error
3. WHEN accessing AWS services THEN the system SHALL use appropriate IAM roles for Lambda to access Bedrock and DynamoDB
4. WHEN starting cold THEN the system SHALL have a cold start time of less than 500ms
5. WHEN handling traffic THEN the system SHALL auto-scale to handle 1000+ requests per minute
6. WHEN logging THEN the system SHALL integrate with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and debugging
7. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL provide one-click deployment scripts or configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer using the API, I want consistent and fast response times with proper error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing valid requests THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms for cached results
2. WHEN making AI requests THEN the system SHALL timeout after 10 seconds and return a fallback response
3. WHEN returning successful responses THEN the system SHALL use the format `{ "code": number, "explanation": string, "fixes": array<string> }`
4. WHEN encountering errors THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (400 for client errors, 500 for server errors)
5. WHEN caching responses THEN the system SHALL use DynamoDB with a TTL of 1 hour
6. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain performance without degradation
7. WHEN the system is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages to help developers troubleshoot

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want automated quality assurance processes to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code files are saved THEN the system SHALL automatically run relevant unit tests
2. WHEN preparing for deployment THEN the system SHALL automatically scan for security vulnerabilities
3. WHEN API changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically update API documentation
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate and display test coverage reports
5. WHEN security scans complete THEN the system SHALL block deployment if critical vulnerabilities are found
6. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL ensure it reflects current API behavior and examples
